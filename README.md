A copycat of Jenkins. Entirely written in python

### Stability
Project is at its embryo stage. Not even early. Project is not
ready for use yet. We'll do our best to be up as soon as we can.

### Basic usage
#### Production Setup
Not yet available

#### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Checkout to your desired branch / tag
   - Currently, master branch is the available branch
     we have as of the moment.
3. Build the image (ensure you have up to date build)
   - `docker-compose build`
4. Run the image
   - Simply do  `docker-compose up` (see logs...)
   - Daemonize by adding `docker-compose up -d`
5. Image is now up and running.

#### Any issues?
Yes. Expect for issues, because what you have now is up-to-date source
that are not yet even tested. We'll give you update


## Initial release date
We'll do early release on this project as soon as we can. Hopefully by
March 2020, we'll have the early release. No solid plan has made, so the
date is just a guesstimate.

## Developer notes / Notes intended for known contributors
  - Kindly go to DEV-NOTES.md

## Want to be a contributor?
  - Contributors as of the moment are within our circle. I will not
    accept any merge request atm aside from my chosen contributors.
    
    We have zero progress atm. So there's just no even way of contributing
    to this project yet, as no one even knows the right direction of this
    project. Sooner or later, we'll come up with a more solid direction.
