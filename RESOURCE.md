# Resource
So guys, have some time reading these stuff(s):

  * JSON Web Token -- https://jwt.io/
  * jwcrypto (I think I might use this one... probably) -- https://jwcrypto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwt.html

### Why jwcrypto
If you'l visit https://jwt.io, this library completes the implementation of jwt.
So far, there were no known security vulnerability report for this library, so I
think, using this library is kind of safe... Probably.

Like I said to you, I consider implementing my own jwt. I might do that, if the
docs is lengthy. And I haven't visited the rtd page of jwcrypto atm. Will read it
later...
